    RpcShared contains globally shared parameters accessible by inheritance or direct access.
    
    It is recommended that all classes that need to interact with the data node should inherit 
    this class to obtain the shared parameters.
    
    Shared Parameters:
        rpc: Static RpcClient instance that maintains a connection to the data node and
            provides methods send requests and the final result. 
        rpc_context: Non-static RpcContext that provides session information required
            to communicate with the data node.
        pado: Pado object. This instance is for the local application use only. It
            is typically set by DNAs that are executed locally. It has no use in
            the data node.
