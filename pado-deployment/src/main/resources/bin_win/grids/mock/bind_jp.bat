:: List all of the hosts that will be part of the grid cluster separated by spaces.
::
:: 1. ServerHost must match the hosts set by $SERVER_HOSTS in ${SITE}_env.sh.
:: 2. ServerBindAddress must be the address that the grid peers use to communicate.
:: 3. ClientBindAddress must be the address the the clients would use to connect
::    to the grid.
::
:: The bind addresses may be required for multi-homed hosts that have more
:: than one IP address. For ServerBindAddress, set the address that belongs
:: to the subnet with the highest bandwidth to provide fast replication.
:: For single-homed hosts, all of the addresses are the same IP address.
:: Note that even for a grid that runs entirely in a single host, you
:: must list the IP address (or localhost). 
::
:: ServerHost must start at each line without leading white characters, i.e., 
:: spaces, tabs, etc.
