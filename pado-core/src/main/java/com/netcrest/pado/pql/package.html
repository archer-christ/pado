	This package contains PQL (Pado Query Language) specific classes.
	Please note the following virtual path limitations.
	<ul>
		<li>The VP current release supports only JsonLite objects.</li>
		<li>Query result set reference must be of a previous query result
			set. For example, a reference to ${1} is not supported in the first
			two queries of the example below.</li>
		<li>Only the AND operator is supported when joining queries. The
			second query in the example below has an AND operator to reference
			${0} fields. The current VP release does not support other operators
			such as OR, NOT, +, and -.</li>
		<li>Virtual path joins are equivalent to inner joins with support
			for distinct field names. Each query result set is merged with the
			previous result set upon field matches. If the same field name exists
			between result sets then the latter always overwrites the former.</li>
	</ul>
